            <br>Saturday’s UFC 296 event is in the books, and now that the dust has settled in Las Vegas, it’s time to go to the scorecard to see who the big winners were at T-Mobile Arena.
            <br><br>
            1 – Leon Edwards
            Leon Edwards is 32 years old. That was the first thing that popped into my head as I began writing this and it’s an important part of his story because of the 11 fighters that
            currently hold belts in the UFC, only three are younger, and two (Islam Makhachev, Sean Strickland) are 32, as well. So, if history is any indication, Edwards is currently in his
            physical prime. To be in his prime and at the top of the 170-pound division is a scary proposition for those trying to take his title, and it sets up some intriguing matchups in 2024,
            with Belal Muhammad and Shavkat Rakhmonov likely the first two on the list for “Rocky,” who made it look easy against Colby Covington on Saturday night.</p>
